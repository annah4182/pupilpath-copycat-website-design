The purpose of doing this project was to make a similar look alike website. I decided to make a copycat web desgin of Pupilpath since I often used it to check my grades. From this project, I learned certain skills when using HTML and CSS. I learned that if you want certain words to be underlined when hovered, you simply use 'text-decoration' and apply hover to the text you want. There were countless of times where I couldn't get my code to work, and tt's either I forgot something or I misspell something. I also had trouble with the margin and padding since I wanted precise positions for my website to look the same as the real one. While coding, I realized that without commenting, it was difficult to find and know what portion of the code was I coding. I had to comment each part of my code before I start coding. What I would do next for this project is to have others click on actual links instead of only hovering over it. For instance, if a student wishes to register, they would have to go to a page where they have to fill out their information. Overall, from this project, I learned to be more organized and was able to complete my project on time.
